# how-many-days-until

A React countdown app of days between today and next year. Future enhancements will allow users to countdown between today and other dates of interest.

Technologies
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) / [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [js-joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/cheat-sheet.html) for managing datetime, which is preferred over JavaScript's built in `Date()`

## [Create-React-App Cheatsheet](https://github.com/M0nica/how-many-days-until/blob/master/CHEATSHEET.md)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run lint`

Run ESLint on the project and apply automatic fixes to code.

### `npm run build`
